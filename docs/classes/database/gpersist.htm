<P>The <A HREF="pod.htm">POD</A> manager and Persistent base class comprise a persistent object framework used to create and maintain persistent objects. The Persistent base class is an abstract class used to define the interface that makes an object persistent. A persistent object is an object that saves its state in-between program invocations. Normally an object's data, stored in memory, is lost when the program terminates. Persistent objects store their data both in memory and in a disk file. When the program is terminated and restarted again, the persistent object can restore its last state by loading its data from the disk file. </P>
<P>In order for the objects of a class to become persistent, the class must inherit the Persistent base class, and define the methods needed to store its objects to disk. The Persistent base class will use the methods defined in the derived class to maintain the data file and index file(s) the database is connected to. The POD (Persistent Object Database) manager is used to manage file pointers to data files and multiple index files. Data files are used to store an object's data to disk. All data files are created by the 32/64-bit <A HREF="gxdbase.htm">database engine</A> and maintained by the Persistent base class. Index files are used to navigate the data file by associating a data key with the address where the object's data can be found in the data file. All index files are created by the 32/64-bit database engine and maintained by the <A HREF="gxbtree.htm">B-tree</A> class. </P>
<P>The public member functions of the Persistent base class will become public member functions in the derived class. The protected member functions and data members will become private members of the derived class. Pure virtual functions are used to define the persistent object interface. The derived class must override the pure virtual functions and define its own procedures for reading, writing, deleting, and searching for its objects in the database. This feature allows you to determine which data members of the derived class are stored in disk. </P>
<P>The Persistent base class is designed to work with or without index files. Index files add relational proprieties to the database. They are used to rapidly locate the objects in the data file using a B-tree algorithm. The B-tree nodes are composed of multiple entry keys consisting of a user-defined key type and a right child pointer. The entry keys are initialized and manipulated by the methods defined in the derived class. The Persistent base class provides the derived class with functions to add, remove, and find keys in the index file. The user-defined key type is responsible for associating data file addresses with the data key. This is generally accomplished by embedding an object ID in the data key. An object ID refers to the data file address of the object. Using data file addresses to identify objects ensures that each object will have a unique ID and allows the index file(s) to index duplicate key names.</P>
<P>The Persistent base class provides the derived class with special functions for reading and writing character strings to data files. Strings are stored by writing the length of the string in a 32-bit integer value and then writing the string itself to the file. If the string is zero bytes in length, one byte will be allocated for the string and a null byte is written in place of the zero length string. When reading a string from the data file, the string length stored on disk is used to allocate a memory buffer for the string plus a null byte. The last byte of the memory buffer is null-terminated. <B>NOTE</B>: With the exception of a zero length string, a null byte is never written at the end of the string. A string must always be null-terminated in memory, unless it is being used to represent a pattern of raw bytes.</P>
<P>Methods for reading and writing user defined types, pointers, and references within an object must be defined in the class derived from the Persistent base class. The gxDatabase engine provides its own <A HREF="idtypes.htm">platform interoperable integers</A> to represent 16/32/64 bit signed and unsigned integers and 64 bit double precision floating point values. The persistent object database files will become platform dependent if built-in types such as short, int, long, float, or double are as persistent data members. </P>

<P>The object header data structure is used to represent the object headers. Object headers are an optional method used to identify objects in the data file by a unique class and object identification number. </P>
<FONT COLOR="#008080"><PRE>// Object header use to ID objects in the data file
struct gxObjectHeader
{
  gxClassID ClassID;   // Class Identification number
  gxObjectID ObjectID; // Object Identification number
};</PRE>
</FONT><P>Object headers should always be stored directly after database block headers. The gxObjectHeader structure stores the class identification number and the object identification number for database objects. Unique object ID numbers can easily be obtained by using the data address to identify objects in the data and index file(s). Using the data file address ensures that the identity of each object will be unique and allows duplicate objects to be stored in the database. The class ID number is an arbitrary value used to identify an object in the database as being an object of a particular class. <B>NOTE</B>: Due to portability issues between the various C++ compilers the Persistent base class does not use RTTI (Run Time Type Information) to identify the objects in the database.</P>
