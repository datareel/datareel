OVERVIEW
--------
What is DataReel?
Datareel is a comprehensive cross-platform C++ development kit used to
build multi-threaded database and communication applications. C++ is a
programming language that produces fast executing compiled programs
and offers very powerful programming capabilities. Unlike interpreted
languages such as JAVA and PERL the C++ language by itself does not
contain built-in programming interfaces for database, communications,
and multi-threaded programming. By using DataReel you can extend the
power of the C++ programming language by using high-level programming
interfaces for database, communications, and multi-threaded
programming.

The DataReel development package was produced by independent work and
contract work released to the public through non-exclusive license
agreements. The initial work began independently in 1997 and was
augmented from 1999 to 2004 by code produced under contract to support
various applications. Several developers throughout the World have
made contributions to enhance the DataReel code and promote its
stability. In 2005 the DataReel code library underwent intense
analysis to produce a bulletproof code base suitable for use in
complex commercial applications. 

Why Use DataReel?
DataReel simplifies complex time consuming database, socket, and
multi-threaded programming tasks by providing JAVA like programming
interfaces for database, communications, and multi-threaded
programming. Using DataReel you can harness the full power of the C++
programming language and build stable end-user applications, embedded
systems, and reusable libraries for multiple operating systems. 

DataReel is flexible. Using DataReel gives your developers the
flexibility to develop core application components independently of
complex user interfaces. DataReel is portable. DataReel not only
offers portability but also interoperability between multiple
platforms. DataReel is modular. DataReel is a modular approach to
network and database programming making code adaptation and
cross-platform testing easy. 

Who Can Use DataReel?
The DataReel toolkit is available to commercial, individual, and
academic developers. The DataReel code base is distributed to the
public in an open source format. This keeps the code stable through
the continued support of worldwide developers who submit code
enhancements and report potential problems. The open source format is
also intended to promote the C++ programming language as the language
of choice for any programming task. 

Who Can Contribute?
The DataReel project accepts bug fixes, enhancements, and additions
from all developers. Project git repo:

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------
The current Datareel release was developed and tested on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 8/9/10, Windows 10/11, and Windows 2025 server.

The datareel library can be compiled on any Linux variant with the
GNU compiler. 

The datareel library can be compiled for Windows using Microsoft
Visual Sudio.

Legacy platforms in the code base include HPUX and Solaris but make
files are no longer distributed. 
 
Datareel has been compiled for use in 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit
applications. The code base still supports 32-bit applications but
current development is mainly for use in 64-bit applications.
      
SUPPORTED COMPILERS
-------------------
For UNIX the current Datareel release supports GNU and Intel compiler
builds. The code base has been used in super computer applications
compiled with Cray C++ compilers.

For Windows the current Datareel release supports Microsoft
Visual Sudio 2022 or 2025.

Previous releases supported cross platform Windows builds using MSVC,
Visual C++, BCC, and DJGPP. 

PACKAGE MAP

BUILDING UNIX SHARED AND STATIC LIBRARIES
--------------------__-------------------
Example install and build:

> mkdir -pv ~/git
> cd ~/git
> git clone https://github.com/datareel/datareel
> cd datareel
> cd env

In the env directory edit the linux.env file if you need to make any
adjustments or modifications to the build 

> source gnu_env.sh
> cd ../build
> make 

> make install
> make clean

To build with OpenSSL:

> export USE_OPEN_SSL=YES
> make -f makefile_ssl
> make -f makefile_ssl install
> make -f makefile_ssl clean

To build example programs:

> cd ~/git/datareel/examples_database
> ls -l 
> cd simple
> make

To build utility programs

> cd ~/git/datareel/utils
> ls
> cd hexdump
> make

BUILDING WINDOWS STATIC LIBRARY and DLL
---------------------------------------
In the example build below we will assume you are working with a copy
of the datareel library unpacked to the "%USERPROFILE%\datareel"
location. 

In this document we will assume you have installed Visual Studio 2026
and will be working on the command line.

To setup a command line build open a Run dialog and enter cmd to open
a command prompt.

To setup the VS 2026 environment the msvc.bat file is provided in the
env directory. 

To build the datareel static library without SSL enabled:

> cd %USERPROFILE%\datareel
> env\msvc.bat
> cd winslib 
> nmake -f msvc.mak

The utility programs and examples programs will link to the static
library. 

To build the example programs:

> cd %USERPROFILE%\datareel\examples_general
> cd string_class
> nmake -f msvc.mak

To build the datareel library as a DLL without SSL enabled:

> cd %USERPROFILE%\datareel
> env\msvc.bat
> cd dll
> nmake -f msvc.mak

To build the datareel static library with SSL enabled:

> cd %USERPROFILE%\datareel
> env\msvc.bat
> cd winslib 
> notepad openssl.env

In the openssl.env file set the path to your openssl installation directory.

> nmake -f msvc_ssl.mak

The utility programs and examples programs will link to the static
library. Before you can build the utils or example programs with SSL
enabled you must set the path to your openssl install in the following
ENV file: 

> cd %USERPROFILE%\datareel\env
> notepad openssl_windows.env

In the openssl_windows.env  set the path to your openssl installation
directory.

To build the example programs:

> cd %USERPROFILE%\datareel\examples_socket
> cd https_client
> nmake -f msvc.mak

Before running the example program in you user environment add the
openssl\bin dir to your PATH:

> set PATH=%PATH%;e:\3plibs\openssl\bin

To build the datareel library as a DLL with SSL enabled:

> cd %USERPROFILE%\datareel
> env\msvc.bat
> cd dll
> notepad openssl.env

In the openssl.env file set the path to your openssl installation directory.

> nmake -f msvc.mak
