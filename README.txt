OVERVIEW
--------
What is DataReel?
Datareel is a comprehensive cross-platform C++ development kit used to
build multi-threaded database and communication applications. C++ is a
programming language that produces fast executing compiled programs
and offers very powerful programming capabilities. Unlike interpreted
languages such as JAVA and PERL the C++ language by itself does not
contain built-in programming interfaces for database, communications,
and multi-threaded programming. By using DataReel you can extend the
power of the C++ programming language by using high-level programming
interfaces for database, communications, and multi-threaded
programming.

The DataReel development package was produced by independent work and
contract work released to the public through non-exclusive license
agreements. The initial work began independently in 1997 and was
augmented from 1999 to 2004 by code produced under contract to support
various applications. Several developers throughout the World have
made contributions to enhance the DataReel code and promote its
stability. In 2005 the DataReel code library underwent intense
analysis to produce a bulletproof code base suitable for use in
complex commercial applications. 

Why Use DataReel?
DataReel simplifies complex time consuming database, socket, and
multi-threaded programming tasks by providing JAVA like programming
interfaces for database, communications, and multi-threaded
programming. Using DataReel you can harness the full power of the C++
programming language and build stable end-user applications, embedded
systems, and reusable libraries for multiple operating systems. 

DataReel is flexible. Using DataReel gives your developers the
flexibility to develop core application components independently of
complex user interfaces. DataReel is portable. DataReel not only
offers portability but also interoperability between multiple
platforms. DataReel is modular. DataReel is a modular approach to
network and database programming making code adaptation and
cross-platform testing easy. 

Who Can Use DataReel?
The DataReel toolkit is available to commercial, individual, and
academic developers. The DataReel code base is distributed to the
public in an open source format. This keeps the code stable through
the continued support of worldwide developers who submit code
enhancements and report potential problems. The open source format is
also intended to promote the C++ programming language as the language
of choice for any programming task. 

Who Can Contribute?
The DataReel project accepts bug fixes, enhancements, and additions
from all developers. Project git repo:

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------
The current Datareel release was developed and tested on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7.2 using GNU g++ 4.8.5 and Intel Parallel Studio XE
2016 update 3. Datareel library can be compiled on any Linux variant
with the GNU compiler. 
The Datareel code base is cross platform and can be compiled using
Microsoft's Visual C++. 
 
Legacy platforms in the code base include HPUX and Solaris.
 
Datareel has been compiled for use in 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit
application. The code base still supports 32-bit applications but
current development is mainly for use in 64-bit applications.
      
SUPPORTED COMPILERS
-------------------
The current Datareel release fully supports GNU and Intel compiler
builds. The code base has been used in super computer applications
compiled with Cray C++ compilers.
 
Previous releases supported cross platform Windows builds using MSVC,
Visual C++, BCC, and DJGPP. The code will still compile on Windows
platforms but the distribution no longer includes the Windows
makefiles and Visual Studio project files.  

PACKAGE MAP

EXAMPLE PROGRAMS
----------------
The Datareel distribution contains several example programs. The
examples are fully functional programs used to test and demonstrate
each component of the library individually. The example programs are
located within subdirectories of the "examples_general",
"examples_database", "examples_threads", and "examples_socket"
directories.

This HTML documentation set include many more example programs that
can by used as templates to build applications. 

DOCUMENTATION

Example install and build:

> mkdir -pv ~/git
> cd ~/git
> git clone https://github.com/datareel/datareel
> cd datareel
> cd env

In the env directory edit the linux.env file if you need to make any
adjustments or modifications to the build 

> source gnu_env.sh
> cd ../build
> make 

> make install
> make clean

To build with OpenSSL:

> export USE_OPEN_SSL=YES
> make -f makefile_ssl
> make -f makefile_ssl install
